  <p>The first, and most important thing to understand about how you learn are the 2 different modes that you brain uses when learning. They are the Focused and Diffuse modes; The Focused mode is what many people think learning "is" it's when you are intently focuses on a problem, trying to find the solution. When using the focused mode, your brain makes quick and similar attempts at solving the problem. As you can see in the image, It can be compared to a pinball machine with bumpers that are very close together. The focused mode is often used when your brain already had an ingrained mental path, on how to solve a particular problem; as can be seen by the black path on the focused mode image.</p><p>The Diffuse mode on the other hand, is useful when you are working on a problem you have never seen before, or are having trouble understanding. When you are using the diffuse mode of thinking your brain can jump from idea to idea, concept to concept. The diffuse mode of thinking is something that many people have trouble using effectively. The best way to use the diffuse mode of thinking to help you solve a difficult problem is to go do something else for a while that isn't to mentally taxing, such as going for a walk or a drive. Another time your brain naturally falls into the diffuse mode of thinking is when you are sleeping. Because of this it can be helpful to look at the problem you are working on right before you go to bed for the night. You will often find that you will wake up with a whole new way to look at the problem!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tomato-timer.com/" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique </a>is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.</p>

<p>Chunking is a term referring to the process of taking individual pieces of information <span>(chunks) </span>and grouping them into larger units. By grouping each piece into a large whole, you can improve the amount of information you can remember. <p>Chunking can be used as an everyday memory enhancer, but researchers have also found that you can improve your ability to effectively chunk information.</p>
